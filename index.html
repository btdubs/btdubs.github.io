		<h2>Competition Robot</h2>
		<p><i>FIRST</i> Competition Robot I programmed and designed.
		 This robot won the <i>FIRST</i> Georgia State Competition.
		 The design expands from a small eighteen inch height to over five feet by utilizing a scissor lift mechanism.
		 Based off a LEGO NXT brick, this robot is programmed in C and won awards for its autonomous path movements.

		<h2>3D Guitar Studio Rendering</h2>
		<p>A 3D model designed in Blender 3D and rendering using Cycles Rendering Engine.
		 Modeled with respect to good topology and quad faces. 
			The material textures are custom procedurally generated and put into studio lighting.
